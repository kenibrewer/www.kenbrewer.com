## Intro
I am a computational biologist and data scientist who is passionate about applying advances in ML and DevOps to massive biological datasets. 
I like to build integrated systems that can rapidly iterate through cycles of design, build, test and learn. 
I am currently building at [ProFound Thearpeutics](https://www.profoundtx.com/).
Thoughts and opinions shared on this site are wholly my own.
